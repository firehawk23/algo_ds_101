### Min Heap Construction 
Implement a MinHeap class that supports: - Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers. - Inserting integers in the heap. - Removing the heap's minimum / root value. - Peeking at the heap's minimum / root value. - Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing values. Note that the heap should be represented in the form of an array.
